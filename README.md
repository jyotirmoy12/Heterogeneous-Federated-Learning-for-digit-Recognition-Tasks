## **Overview**
This project implements **Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL)** for **digit recognition tasks**, using various machine learning models. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how Federated Learning can be applied in a real-world scenario where clients (devices or nodes) have heterogeneous data and models.


## **Key Features**
- **Federated Learning Framework**: Implements a distributed approach where clients (devices) train models locally on their private data, and only model updates are shared.
- **Heterogeneous Models**: The system supports heterogeneous models, allowing clients to use different types of neural networks, which are then aggregated into a global model.
- **Digit Recognition**: This project is focused on digit recognition using standard datasets like MNIST or custom datasets for recognizing handwritten digits.
